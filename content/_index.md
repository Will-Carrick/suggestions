# A New Law

This is the beginning of a verison of the law for a new nation. A nation whose citizens are those who voluntarily subject themselves to the laws enumerated within this text. This law shall be maintained in a way different past laws -- that is it will be maintained using version control. Anyone may propose changes, and you may use `git` or another DVCS to customize your version of the law.

Another difference between the law of this voluntary nation, and that of other nations, is that we believe the totality of the law should be readable and understandable by the majority of our citizenry.

Here are the rules I will abide by as a citizen of this nation:

* I will not kill people excepting in self defense.
* I will not take things from other people that do not belong to me.
