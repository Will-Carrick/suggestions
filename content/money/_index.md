## Currency

It is easily argued that commodity monies are insufficient for the operation of large scale economies.  At the same time, paper money requires a counterparty.  To mitigate the counterparty risk, this counterparty must maintain a standing military and police force to enforce various requirements on the use of money.

Both of these issues render a society based on voluntary participation impossible.  However, in 2009 we invented Bitcoin which is a cryptographic currency which has no counterparty risk, and allows for cryptographic verifiable of various things.
